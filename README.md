# miCPPgrad
miCPPgrad (my c++ grad) is a tiny scalar-valued autograd engine in c++ inspired by [Kaparthy's micrograd]([url](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd))

Play around with it in `src/main.cpp`
and run it with
```shell
./run.sh
```

Run testcases
```shell
./run.sh test
```

Skip the build by adding `skipbuild` as an arg
```shell
./run.sh skipbuild
```
